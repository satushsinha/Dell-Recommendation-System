It was the best bargain at that price. With i5 intel processor, ssd and hdd drive, 8 Gb ram, ms office... It was a steal deal. I'm really really happy with product. The design isn't that great and there was no color option as such but it does its job with precision. The start up is less than 10 secs which is like awesome. The battery back up too lasts for like 5 hours and I'm jus doing my normal office work with the music playing in the background. All in all I must say this the best you can get for the price. üôÇREAD MORE"

It has a textured panel on the top which is good and the matt black color gives it a simple look. It takes less than a minute to boot the laptop. I disabled few startup apps and Services from task manager which improved the booting time. Though it has a 8th generation core i5 CPU the performance is slow at times. Apps don't respond on a single/ double click and take time to load. This might be due to the presence of HDD and absence of SSD. However, in this price range there is no laptop with Intel i5 processor which offers SSD with large storage(Except for Asus). Sound front the inbuilt speaker is loud enough if you are listening in a quiet place. With background noise even with high volume the sound is inaudible. The quality is crisp and clear though. Keyboard is NOT backlit and is a bit cramped to my liking. The arrow keys are small and need sometime to get adjusted to. Battery life is around 5 to 6 hours with moderate usage like browsing, working on documents etc. When playing games the battery takes a toll as the Radeon graphics card comes into play drawing more power to deliver good gaming experience. Games like Asphalt 9, Asphalt Xtreme play smoothly without any lag. I have not tried PUBG but it should run fine with medium graphics setting. If you want a laptop with fast response opt for a one with SSD. If you are budget is around 45 to 50K this laptop is decent. One of the main reasons for buying this laptop was pre-installed MS OFFICE and good price in exchange for my old Dell Vostro 3550. I hope my review helps buyers to choose a laptop as per their needs.READ MORE"

(you have the option to choose high performance, battery saver or medium performance).2. No LED indicator for power button, power on/off, Fn mode, num lock or any other indicator. there is one LED at the bottom which can be flipped between charging indicator & hard disk activity indicator. major drawback.3. device performance is impacted when McAfee is running constantly and if a Microsoft account is used for login user. switched to local account and suspended McAfee, working fine now.4. sound quality is nothing extraordinary but sufficient for daily use. not highly recommended if you're taking webex meetings over device audio/mic. 5. available storage is 1.8TB and you must give minimum 0.9GB to C drive if you're partitioning it.6. USB ports are slightly hard but not a drawback.7. takes around 4-5mins for start up and a minute to shut down (without windows updates)Thanks.READ MORE"

There was an exchange scheme available at that time and I got a massive discount of rupees 20000 on my old laptop. The config of old laptop was Acer Aspire-5740 that has i3 Processor and build year was 2010. This was a special summer offer provided by Dell and one additional promotional discount offered by Flipkart. (MRP price listed Rs. 1,14,290  + Pick up charge Rs. 100) ‚Äì (Exchange discount Rs. 20000 + Promotion Discount Rs 2000) = Rs 92,390So, effective price was Rs 92,390. Great discount possible through combine efforts of Dell and Flipkart. I do not need to tell further that it was a lightning deal.To begin with, I purchased this laptop on 22nd May 2017. So, effectively I have used this laptop for almost 4 months. After an extensive use of this laptop I am writing detailed review. This laptop is available in two colors Red and Black. The red color was not available so I purchased the black one. As, I can see Red color is still not available.Beginning with build Features1.	The laptop has black matt finish and I have not found any problem with that. It has a rubbery feel and texture. The Laptop screen has TN Panel, most of us definitely wanted IPS panel. In India,  IPS panel for this model is not available yet. The best thing about TN panel is that you will get a battery backup of around 10 hours on web browsing and guys it is really a boon for those who do not want to spend most of their time near wall socket. But those who cannot compromise with IPS Panel, it is a missing feature.2.	The Laptop keyboard is really cool, it has Red LED backlit with three intensity level. The touchpad is also great. I am an ardent fan of wireless mouse, so I do not use touch pad that much. 3.	It has rear-exiting cooling vents with dual cooling fans and NVIDIA GeForce graphic with advanced thermal cooling design. There is no such heating issue with laptop. The Graphic card works smooth even at the maximum throughput. I have tested rigorously, both intel I7 processor and graphic card  to full throttle i.e. using all the cores of both the processor and graphic at same time. But that was insane you are never going to use both the devils at same time at full throttle. So be assured this laptop is robust and come out as champ and shows cool temperament  all the time like Indian Skipper Dhoni. 4.	The Laptop has 3 USB slots, 1 LAN Port, 1 HDMI, 1 3.5 mm Jack and 1 SD-CARD Reader. There is no thunderbolt in this laptop and I think this feature is a must in such high-end laptop. 5.	It takes around 2.2 hours to charge the battery and yeah battery is huge. With extensive use battery will last around 6 hours. For normal web browsing it will last around 10 hours. I have already mentioned about backup in point 1.6.	The laptop speakers are above average but not anything special about them. I prefer to use headphones. All the famous youtubers/channels make adult comedy. So, headphone is the need of hour.Coming to Performance of laptop7.	The day I switched on laptop first time, it hardly took 5 seconds to boot the windows.  A great thanks to combination of 256 GB SSD + 16 GB RAM. Though it has not the state-of-art SSD but it works smooth.8.	From Adobe photoshop, Illustrator to Adobe Video Editing. It works smooth, thanks again to i7 , 256 SSD and 16 GB RAM. For video editing, SSD and 8 GB Ram is must. This laptop configuration surpasses all the basic limits.9.	Though, I am not a gaming enthusiast but throw any game at it. The NVIDIA 1050Ti will never disappoint you. The Difference b/w 1050 and 1050 Ti is that ‚ÄúTi‚Äù is the energy efficient design from NVIDIA and consumes less battery and generates less heat.10.	I have also done mining on this laptop, it works fine. Though, I will not suggest you to do so because mining consumes lots of battery and consistently using processor and graphic at full throttle for hours should be avoided. Open rigs are best for such purpose. No doubt this laptop is a beast but take care of it. You are Aladdin and your beast is Genie. It will never fail you in long run.11.	For long term investment, this laptop is great. There will be no problem regarding H/W upgradation, it is one of the best of its times. Also, you can extend your RAM up to 32 GB. Five years down the line, I do not see any problems for such a beast.12.	You get factory installed Windows 10 on 256 GB SSD. Apart from that I installed windows 7 and Ubuntu as dual boot on 1 TB storage. Yeah, Dell has no support for drivers regarding Windows 7 but I managed to do that. Anyone who needs the driver for Windows 7 can post the question, I will share the link. Please remember it is unofficial, Dell cannot provide any support for Windows 7.13.	There were no additional accessories provided with the laptop. 5 STARS as it solves my purpose.  Knowledge is all about sharing. Cheers!!!!READ MORE"
